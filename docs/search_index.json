This website serves as the central repository for all course materials. Here, you will find all slides, lecture materials, and links to your online development environment. 0.1 Course Objective Most academic fields require proficiency in at least one data-centered analysis tool. For many, the R programming language has become the tool of choice. However, the first steps in coding can be intimidating and discouragingprimarily if you have never worked with a programming language before. This course aims at providing a results-oriented, applied, and hands-on introduction to the essential parts of a Data Science project in R. We will introduce the libraries and frameworks necessary for your analysis and focus on teaching you the implementation and application of those tools. Well present small examples throughout the lecture and provide you with application exercises that you can work on for yourself. Our goal is to show you the scope of possibilities within R and leave you with the impression that you can confidently implement your empirical projects in R. We will focus on the Tidyverse ecosystem, a consistent and intuitive framework for building your data analysis from start to finish. After completing this course, you know how to apply the essential Tidyverse tools for everyday Data Science tasks in Rprimarily data wrangling, data visualization, and communicating results. 0.2 Course Description We aim this course at beginners who are either entirely new to R as a programming language and/or want to learn about the Tidyverse ecosystem. The course covers four primary areas of the typical data science process and introduces the respective tidyverse tools: Plotting with ggplot2 Data wrangling with dplyr Communicating your results with R Markdown Regressions with tidymodels We will not cover statistical or theoretical concepts in this course, as the focus will lie on applied coding. 0.3 Methods We will let you eat cake first. What does that mean? Many programming courses start with the absolute basics  variable types, syntax, loops, etc. Those are important but quite dull in the beginning. Instead of monotonously walking you through those, we follow a different teaching philosophy. Each topic will start with a very friendly and sometimes a bit complicated cake. And you will dive right into it by executing and adapting the code for that data science cake. For example, we will show you an advanced visualization right at the beginning of the course and focus on what is possible eventually. While this might appear intimidating at first (how should I ever be able to code that from scratch?), we will walk you through the steps and introduce the methods to get there during the course. The course will alternate between short introductions to a concept or method and small do-it-yourself coding exercises. In between the three sessions, you are encouraged to work on provided exercises that further deepen your understanding. 0.4 Conditions This workshop is a beginner-friendly course. You do not need prior coding experience. But you are also more than welcome to participate if you are an experienced R user but want to learn more about the Tidyverse. You will need an RStudio Cloud account. RStudio Cloud is a very convenient Integrated Development Environment, where we provide you with all necessary code to follow the course and work with small application exercises on your own. By not installing RStudio locally during the course, we can start right away with the more critical course content. If you already have set up a local installation of RStudio, you are, of course, more than welcome to use that instead. In this case, download the source files linked in the respective application exercises. Note that you wont need to set anything up if you use RStudio Cloud. Since we do not want to waste precious time on the technical setup, we will use the RStudio Cloud as a simpleand already set updevelopment environment. We will send out detailed instructions and an invitation link in advance. 0.5 Course Organization &amp; Video Recordings We will meet on three Thursday evenings from 6:00 - 8:00 p.m. Please access the course via this Zoom link or the meeting ID 933 0794 1729 and passcode 692604. Part Date Time Video Recording 1 13 January 2022 18:00 - 20:00 We will upload the video recording after the course here 2 20 January 2022 18:00 - 20:00 We will upload the video recording after the course here 3 27 January 2022 18:00 - 20:00 We will upload the video recording after the course here We want you to make your hands dirty  that means we want you to code! Just following along fancy slides wont magically transfer the skill of coding to you. But you actively engaging with the course content in your development environment will more likely do just that. Thats why we need you to prepare accordingly: Try to follow the course with two screens or two devices (one for Zoom and the slides, and one for your browser with RStudio Cloud) Please create an RStudio Cloud account before the first class. We have sent you a link to access all exercises on RStudio Cloud. Since we want you to start coding very early on in the first class, please ensure that you can access those course materials on RStudio Cloud before meeting on 13 January. If you have any questions, please reach out to one of us through the e-mail addresses on the bottom of this page. 0.6 Schedule This workshop alternates between lecture-style presentations and application exercises. In those hands-on exercises, you will actively try out the discussed tools and techniques in Zoom breakout rooms. We aim to adhere to the following schedule. Depending on our progress, we may discuss some parts a bit earlier or later during the course. You can download a .ics calendar with the schedule and the Zoom link here.

"],["hello-world.html", "Chapter 1 Hello world 1.1 Slides, application exercises, and references", " Chapter 1 Hello world We will start by showing you what is possible at the end of the class and running a reasonably complex visualization code in your environment. The goal of this Hello world part is not to make you understand every bit of the code but instead, make you hungry for more. We aim for you to code such a visualization from scratch at the end of our course. To reach that goal, we will  step by step  introduce you to the most relevant facets of Data Science with R and the Tidyverse.

We will not cover the mechanics of individual statistical models, but scratch the surface of a very intuitive way of coding up your models in R. You might have come across the standard way of coding up a linear regression in R  the function lm(). Instead of using lm(), we introduce you to the tidy way of linear regressions in R through the tidymodels package. This approach builds on the tidy approach to data visualization and data wrangling. We will not go through all slides during the lecture  the main focus lies on the tidy way of modeling and not the actual statistics behind it.

If you want to continue with this course, you can access many more lecture materials (including recorded videos, interactive tutorials, and exercises) at datasciencebox.org. Check out Neuroscience Packages This course was a subject-agnostic introduction to the programming language R and the tidyverse packages. The beauty of R, however, is the vast number of subject-specific packages. For example, check out natverse, a tidyverse-inspired collection of packages for neuroanatomical data analysis. Join TechAcademy e.V. TechAcademy e.V. is a student organization at Goethe University educating students in Data Science with R or Python and Web Development. Students of all academic subjects can develop coding skills through the Data Science and Web Development programs. Your course instructors are part of the organizations management team. Feel free to join us! You can do so, either as students for one of our programs (at the beginning of each semester) or as part of our voluntary team. Find more information on tech-academy.io. Join the Campus useR Group in Frankfurt Theres a pretty active R community in Frankfurt that meets once a month. Its open for students, professors, industry practitioners, journalists, and all people that love to use R. In those meetings, youll hear about others work, discuss new developments, and ask questions. All levels of expertise are welcome. Check it out on Meetup. Follow the R Community The R community is amiable, helpful, and engaging. For example, follow #rstats on Twitter, and you will see many significant use cases, new developments, and a bunch of tips and tricks that you have never heard of before. Install R and RStudio locally If you have used RStudio Cloud so far, the next step should be to set everything up on your local computer. RStudio Cloud is excellent for getting started with R without having to worry about installing anything locally. For more significant projects, though, you should set up R and RStudio Cloud in your environment. Version Control with Git If youre serious about data science, you will need Git. Better learn it early and start enjoying and appreciating it before its too late and youre pressured into learning it on the fly! You should version every project you do with Git. Regardless if youre working alone or with a big group of developers. Regardless if you write ten lines of code or a complex program. With Git, you can keep track of all your changes. Its like a Dropbox/Google Drive for developers, but way better. Pro-Tip: Get free GitHub Pro as a student with the GitHub Student Developer Pack. RStudio has a friendly interface that lets you enjoy the perks of Git without ever having to touch the command line  sounds great, does it? Learn how to set up the Git &amp; R workflow with Happy Git with R. Inspiration and Tools for Great Visualizations Get inspiration to take your plotting to the next level at the R Graph Gallery. The gallery also includes code to reproduce the plots. R and RStudio are two uniquely customizable tools. For example, RStudio allows Add-ins that sometimes offer a simplified access to certain tools or techniques. In the visualization context, two of those extensions are esquisse for a graphical interface to ggplot2 ggx for easy ggplot2 help. See what else is possible in R R and RStudio are potent tools to do many things beyond traditional Data Science. For example, we wrote all course materials (including the website and slides) in R Markdown. You can also write your entire doctoral thesis in R Markdown tools without ever leaving RStudio. Everything from data analysis to results communication can be implemented and connected such that you never have to paste tables and figures into a Word document manually. You can find many valuable references at RStudio Education. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
