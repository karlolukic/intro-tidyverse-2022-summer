# Course Objective

Most academic fields require proficiency in at least one data-centered analysis tool.
For many, the R programming language has become the tool of choice.

However, the first steps in coding can be intimidating and discouraging — especially if you have never worked with a programming language before.
This course aims at providing a results-oriented, applied, and hands-on introduction to the most important parts of a Data Science project in R.
We will not only introduce the libraries and frameworks necessary for your analysis, but also focus on teaching you the implementation and application of those tools with small examples that you can work on yourself.

Our goal is to show you the scope of possibilities within R and leave you with the impression that you can confidently implement your own empirical projects in R.
We will focus on the Tidyverse ecosystem, a consistent and intuitive framework of building your data analysis from start to finish.
After the successful completion of this course, you know how to apply the basic Tidyverse tools for common Data Science tasks in R — primarily data wrangling, data visualization, and results communication.
