# Introduction to Data Science with R and Tidyverse

This repository contains all materials for the course *Introduction to Data Science with R and Tidyverse*, offered for GRADE Brain at Goethe University in the summer term of 2021.
Additionally, it serves the course website for students, which you can access [here](https://lukas-jue.github.io/intro-tidyverse)

# Course Objective

Most academic fields require proficiency in at least one data-centered analysis tool.
For many, the R programming language has become the tool of choice.

However, the first steps in coding can be intimidating and discouraging — primarily if you have never worked with a programming language before.
This course aims at providing a results-oriented, applied, and hands-on introduction to the most critical parts of a Data Science project in R.
We will introduce the libraries and frameworks necessary for your analysis and focus on teaching you the implementation and application of those tools with small examples that you can work on yourself.

Our goal is to show you the scope of possibilities within R and leave you with the impression that you can confidently implement your empirical projects in R.
We will focus on the Tidyverse ecosystem, a consistent and intuitive framework for building your data analysis from start to finish.
After completing this course, you will know how to apply the essential Tidyverse tools for everyday Data Science tasks in R — primarily data wrangling, data visualization, and communicating results.
